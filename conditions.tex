\section{Automata condition}

For cofinitely many words $w$ there is a point $x$ such that every other
point can be reached from $x$ with a $w$-path.

Does not work because it does not force reflexive loops.


\section{More complex condition}

A point $x$ is a \emph{candidate} for $w$ if
\begin{itemize}
 \item $x$ sees every other point over $w$.
 \item if $w$ is a repetition of $v$ then $x$ has a $v$-loop.
\end{itemize}

The condition is that there are only finitely many words for which there
is no candidate.


\section{Easier version of the more complex condition}

For all words $w$ there is a point $x$ such that
\begin{itemize}
 \item $x$ sees every other point under $w^n$ for some $n$, and
 \item $x$ has a $w$ loop.
\end{itemize}

This condition is not enough because of the hamburger example.

We can map:
\[
\begin{array}{lll}
 00\star & \mapsto a \\
 01\star & \mapsto a \\
 10\star & \mapsto c \\
 11\star & \mapsto b
\end{array}
\]

There is a $1010$-path from $c$ to $b$, it goes $c \rightarrow_1 a
\rightarrow_0 a \rightarrow_1 c \rightarrow_0 b$.


\section{Cycle condition}

Given a word $w = a_1 \dots a_n$ the set of cyclings of $w$ is the set
$C(w) = \{uv \mid vu = w\}$. Note that the number of elements in $C(w)$
is bound by $|w|$.

For all words $w$ there is an assigment $x : C(w) \to P$ such that for
all $v \in C(w)$:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $x(v)$ sees every other point under $v^n$ for some $n$, and
 \item $x(v) \rightarrow_a x(ua)$ if $v = au$.
\end{enumerate}

This might not exclude the hamburger!
