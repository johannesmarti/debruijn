\section{Automata condition}

For cofinitely many words $w$ there is a point $x$ such that every other
point can be reached from $x$ with a $w$-path.

Does not work because it does not force reflexive loops.


\section{More complex condition}

A point $x$ is a \emph{candidate} for $w$ if
\begin{itemize}
 \item $x$ sees every other point over $w$.
 \item if $w$ is a repetition of $v$ then $x$ has a $v$-loop.
\end{itemize}

The condition is that there are only finitely many words for which there
is no candidate.


\section{Easier version of the more complex condition}

For all words $w$ there is a point $x$ such that
\begin{itemize}
 \item $x$ sees every other point under $w^n$ for some $n$, and
 \item $x$ has a $w$ loop.
\end{itemize}

(I think that if the $0$ and $1$ relations in the pattern are right
total then this is entailed by the previous condition. If
the relations are not right total we already know that there is no de
Bruijn homomorphism.)
This condition is co-c.e. The $n$ in the first bullet point can
be bound!
