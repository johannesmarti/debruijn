\section{Simple path condition}

There is a subset $S$ of the pattern such that for each word $w$ there
is a node $s \in S$ which has a $w$-loop and such that there is a
$w$-path form $s$ to any other node $s' \in S$.

Example~2 shows that this condition is not sufficient.


\section{Path condition}

For all words $w$ there is a node $s_w$ such that $s_w$ has a $w$ loop
and for all $w'$ there is some $n$ such that there is a $w$-path of
length $n \cdot |w| + o(w,w')$ from $s_w$ to $s_{w'}$. Here, $o(w,w')$ is then
length of the shortest $u$ such that $w = u \cdot v$ and $w' = v \cdot
z$.



\iffalse
0011 to 010

path is of length 4n + 0

00110011001
01001001001
there is a path of lenght 9!
