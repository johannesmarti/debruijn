\section{The definition}

Let $P$ be a pattern. The lifting $L(P)$ is a pattern that has as nodes
all subsets $V \subseteq P$ with $V \neq \emptyset$ and $|V| \leq 2$.
The relations are defined such that for both $a \in \{0,1\}$ we have
\[
 V \rightarrow_a W \iff \mbox{there is some } v \in V \mbox{ such that }
v \rightarrow_a w \mbox{ for all } w \in W.
\]
One can show that if there is a homomorphism $h : P \to Q$ then there is
a homomorphism $L(h) : L(P) \to L(Q)$. Thus, the lifting is a monotone
operation on the homomorphism lattice. One can also show that there is a
homomorphism $e : P \to L(P)$ for all patterns $P$. The homomorphism $e$
maps any $v \in P$ to $e(v) = \{v\}$.

The motivation for this notion is that one can show the following: For
all patterns $P$ and numbers $n$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lifting property}
 T_{n + 1} \to P \iff T_n \to L(P).
\end{equation}
Thus, it follows that $T_n \to P$ iff $T_0 \to L^n(P)$, where $L^n$
denotes the $n$-fold application of $L$. Note that $T_0 \to L^n(P)$ just
means that $L^n(P)$ has a point with reflexive $0$ and $1$-loops.


\section{The proof}

We are now going to prove \eqref{eq:lifting property}.
\begin{theorem}
 For all patterns $P$ and numbers $n \in \omega$  
\begin{equation*}
 T_{n + 1} \to P \iff T_n \to L(P).
\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For the left-to-right direction assume that we have a homomorphism $h :
T_{n + 1} \to P$. We define that homomorphism $g : T_n \to L(P)$ by
setting $g(v) = \{h(v0),h(v1)\}$ for all $v \in \Sigma^n$.

\end{proof}


\section{The plan}

The idea is to show that iterated applications of $L$ reaches a fixpoint
after finitely many steps. That is, we want to show that for every
pattern $P$ there is some computable $n$ such that $L^{n + 1}(P) \to
L^n(P)$. Because $P \to L(P)$ and $L$ is monotone we have that $L^{n +
1}(P) \leftarrow L^n(P)$, which entails means that $L^{n + 1} (P)$ and
$L^n(P)$ are homomorphically equivalent. Then, all larger $L^k(P)$ with
$k \geq n$ are also homomorphically equivalent to $L^n(P)$. We can then
check whether $T_0 \to L^k(P)$ for any $k$, by simply checking whether
$T_0 \to L^n(P)$.
